# ReactJS Path Finding Visualizer

Visualize different Path Finding Algorithms in this Visualizer. Currently, you can visualize 5 most known path finding algorithms using this project. You can find shortest path between two Nodes and visualize the whole process at different speeds.  
You can make Obstacles/Walls in the grid and see how algorithms find Path when they detect obstacles. This project has a Maze Generation algorithm from which you can generate a Maze in the Grid.  
You can play with this Project here: (**[https://sllark.github.io/path-finder-visualizer-js/](https://sllark.github.io/path-finder-visualizer-js/)**)



## Algorithms

Currently, the visualizer has 5 following algorithms:

- A* Algorithm
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- Breadth First Search Algorithm
- Depth First Search Algorithm
- Greedy First Search Algorithm


##### Visualizer has a Maze Generation Algorithm based on Recursive Division Algorithm

### Instructions:

- Click on Start/End Node to select it. After selecting the node, move your mouse on Grid to rearrange the Node

- Click on White/Empty Box and start moving your mouse on Grid to make a Wall. To stop creating the wall, Click again on the Grid.

- Chose Algorithm, from top-left Dropdown, which you want to play with.

- If you want to add a Maze or random Walls in the Grid, you can select it from "Generate" Dropdown.

- Click "Start" Button to start the Visualizer and see the magic.

- You can change Speed of Visualizer from "Speed" Dropdown preset at top-right side.

- Play with different Algorithms and have fun :)
